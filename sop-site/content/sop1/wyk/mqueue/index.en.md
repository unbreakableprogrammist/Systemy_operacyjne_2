# Message queues

## Scope

- Basic information about POSIX interfaces to IPC.
    - Three types of IPC objects: message queues, shared memory segments, semaphores.
    - Two families of interface functions: `IPC UNIX System V`, `POSIX IPC`
    - IPC object persistence: kernel, processs, file system.
    - Namespaces, IPC object visibility (e.g. in the file system)
- `POSIX IPC` interface to message queues and shared memory:
    - Namespace, persistence, visibility.
    - Message, message priority, message passing (limited buffering, retrieval: the oldest message of the highest
      priority - first), asynchronous notification, message queue removal and its consequences.
    - Shared memory segment: creation, attaching/detaching, access modes, access violations, marking segment for remvoal
      vs. removal from the system.
    - Calls of `fork()`, `exec()`, `_exit()` functions and IPC objects.
    - (\*\*) Interface design and example use
        - Visibility of IPC objects in the file system
        - Interface functions related to message queues (`mq_*()`) and shared memory segments (`shm_*()`, `ftruncate()`,
          `mmap()` etc.); selected data structures of the interface.
        - Asynchronous notification when a new message arrives at the empty message queue.
- Message queues - `UNIX System V IPC` interface
    - Namespace, persistence, visibility.
    - Message, message type, message passing (limited buffering, selective retrieval: FIFO order, by type), message
      queue removal and its consequences.
    - Shared memory segment: creation, attaching/detaching, access modes, access violations, marking segment for remvoal
      vs. removal from the system.
    - (\*) Interface design and example use
        - Visibility of IPC objects in the system; system commands (`ipcs`, `ipcrm`)
        - Interface functions for message queues (`msg*()`) and shared memory segments (`shm*()`); selected data
          structures of the interface.
